## Killer Sudoku 
This is my implementation of Killer Sudoku. (general rules: https://killersudokuonline.com/rules.html)

## How to use
Simply put, first one must click on the cell, and then the number on the bottom. On the right,
one can see the possible combinations for the cage the desired cell is a part of. The different
colors represent the different cages. As one is hovering over the cells, they can also see 
the available numbers represented by color green and the non-available numbers represented by red.

## Known issues and possible improvements
- the options aren't always shown when attempting to continue a previous game
- repeated blocks of code
- simple color choosing algorithm
- GUI could be improved -- for instance, in terms of accessibility as colors are the only thing that
represent the different cages
