FIRST INTERIM REPORT 6.3.2022

I have added the BigGrid- and SubArea-classes as well
as some work for the ScalaFX. Now it contains the unfinished
grid and candidate numbers. The sub-area now calculates all
possible combinations and big grid has most of its basic functionality,
although without the class square it isn't finished.

I've tested the possibleCombinations-method in REPL and will add the
unit testing this week, probably. I've also tested BigGrid's main functions
with REPL.

It was difficult to get the ScalaFX to work even with completely
copying the information in the A+-material. My friend helped me with it. :-D

I think the workload has already been around 10 to 15-ish hours, although I'm lagging
in the schedule because most of the time is spent searching for tips on ScalaFX...
It's hard to keep up with the schedule because all the other courses at the moment take a lot
of time as well and their deadlines happen to be more or less weekly...
