FIRST INTERIM REPORT 6.3.2023

I have added the killer.BigGrid- and killer.SubArea-classes as well
as some work for the ScalaFX. Now it contains the unfinished
grid and candidate numbers. The sub-area now calculates all
possible combinations and big grid has most of its basic functionality,
although without the class square it isn't finished.

I've tested the possibleCombinations-method in REPL and will add the
unit testing this week, probably. I've also tested killer.BigGrid's main functions
with REPL.

It was difficult to get the ScalaFX to work even with completely
copying the information in the A+-material. My friend helped me with it. :-D

I think the workload has already been around 10 to 15-ish hours, although I'm lagging
in the schedule because most of the time is spent searching for tips on ScalaFX...
It's hard to keep up with the schedule because all the other courses at the moment take a lot
of time as well and their deadlines happen to be more or less weekly...

SECOND INTERIM REPORT 20.3.2023

I've implemented the basic version of the gui, since last time I added the box for
possible combinations (although not working yet). Now the user can add numbers to the
squares, and it also sends error messages if the user tries to add numbers to the squares
they cannot be added to. I've also realised that the sub-grid class is probably useless,
and I've replaced it by mapping the squares to their corresponding sub-grids. I fixed some
issues with the sub-grid's logic of checking whether the same numbers had been added to the
row or column before. I tested these with the gui.

Next I'll work on the sub-areas. I asked some help from the assistant before, but I'm not sure
if it would be easier to just color the sub-areas with different colors since I cannot figure out
how to differentiate them from each other with the dashed lines :-D I'm still not exactly on schedule,
but I think the main missing points are the highlighting of the candidate numbers, sub-areas and the file-
handling. And the tests I'll have to make!!

THIRD INTERIM REPORT 3.4.2023

Now the program highlights the numbers that can be added to the square when the user is hovering over it.
In addition, when the user is hovering over the candidate numbers, the grid highlights instances of that
number already added to the grid. Moreover, the user may now delete the numbers from the grid. All of these
I've tested with the GUI, although I'll have to work on the other tests as well. The highlighting part
took quite a bit of time (didn't work with the for-loop correctly, but started working when I switched to
foreach... this one I was stuck in for a long time). But now all of those functionalities are working.

The main things that are still missing are the cages (sub-areas) and the possible combinations (although after
I get the cages to work, I think that shouldn't be too difficult to work out). The other part still missing is the
file reading part, but I think I have a good idea on how to work on that later on, since the main thing to save
is just the numbers already on the grid and the cages I can get from the internet. I'll have more time to work
on this project for this last part of the project, since other courses have fewer deadlines. However, I think
my progress is looking good over all since the main functions are working with the GUI now (aside from the cages).
